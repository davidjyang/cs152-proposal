# ClassicallyTrained
##### A project proposal for CS152

## Project Description

For this project, I hope to train neural networks (NNs) in a general adversarial network (GAN) to create music. In order to do this, I plan to train NNs on existing datasets of sheet music images of classical music and eventually generate its own sheet music. 

The GAN, after being trained, will be deployed as an application where it can generate measures of new music, based on the classical data set that it was trained on. If the project works ideally, then it would be potentially possible to train the GAN on multiple genres and be able to generate genre-distinct music. In addition, anything created would not be significantly distinguishable from the “real” music it would have been trained on. 

A long-term goal for this project is to explore the idea of generating something within an auditory medium via purely visual inputs; on a broader scale, explore how an AI can create art and its distinguishability from human-created art. 


## Project Goals

1. Find a dataset of sheet music (potentially classical, 1-3 instruments).
2. Train a GAN on this dataset to be able to emulate key aspects of the dataset.
3. Expand and train the GAN in order to generate more genres based on more datasets.
4. Potentially combine training sets and genres in order to explore more music generation possibilities.
5. Explore ethical considerations of using an AI to create art.

## Questions to Answer

1. If the project succeeds and is able to generate music based on a training data set, who/what gets credit for the generated music?
2. Would generating music too close to the dataset be plagiarism?
3. Would music (an auditory medium) be able to be successfully created purely based on sheet music (visual inputs) and if so, would it be unique from the dataset of "real" music?
